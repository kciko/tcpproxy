DESCRIPTION
-----------

*tcpproxy* is a simple tcp connection proxy which combines the 
features of rinetd and 6tunnel. *tcpproxy* supports IPv4 and 
IPv6 and also supports connections from IPv6 to IPv4 endpoints 
and vice versa.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options can be passed to the *tcpproxy* daemon:

*-D, --nodaemonize*::
   This option instructs *tcpproxy* to run in foreground
   instead of becoming a daemon which is the default.

*-u, --username <username>*::
   run as this user. If no group is specified (*-g*) the default group of 
   the user is used. The default is to not drop privileges.

*-g, --groupname <groupname>*::
   run as this group. If no username is specified (*-u*) this gets ignored.
   The default is to not drop privileges.

*-C, --chroot <path>*::
   Instruct *tcpproxy* to run in a chroot jail. The default is 
   to not run in chroot.

*-P, --write-pid <filename>*::
   Instruct *tcpproxy* to write it's pid to this file. The default is 
   to not create a pid file.

*-L, --log <target>:<level>[,<param1>[,<param2>[..]]]*::
   add log target to logging system. This can be invoked several times
   in order to log to different targets at the same time. Every target 
   hast its own log level which is a number between 0 and 5. Where 0 means
   disabling log and 5 means debug messages are enabled. +
   The file target can be used more the once with different levels.
   If no target is provided at the command line a single target with the 
   config *syslog:3,tcpproxy,daemon* is added. +
   The following targets are supported:

   *syslog*;; log to syslog daemon, parameters <level>[,<logname>[,<facility>]]
   *file*;; log to file, parameters <level>[,<path>]
   *stdout*;; log to standard output, parameters <level>
   *stderr*;; log to standard error, parameters <level>

*-U, --debug*::
   This option instructs *tcpproxy* to run in debug mode. It implicits *-D* 
   (don't daemonize) and adds a log target with the configuration
   *stdout:5* (logging with maximum level). In future releases there might
   be additional output when this option is supplied.
